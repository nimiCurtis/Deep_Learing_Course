## Exercises

This repository includes several exercise folders. Each folder focuses on a specific topic or technique, providing you with hands-on practice and the opportunity to apply your knowledge. The exercise folders are organized as follows:

1. [**Exercise_#1_CNN_Basics**](Deep_Learning_Course/Exersice_#1_CNN_Basics/): In this exercise, you will dive into the fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). You will learn about the architecture of CNNs, their building blocks, and how they are applied to solve various image classification problems.

2. [**Exercise_#2_RNN**](Deep_Learning_Course/Exersice_#2_RNN/): This exercise will introduce you to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their applications. You will explore different RNN architectures and understand how they are used for sequence data processing tasks, such as text generation.

3. [**Exercise_#3_VAE_&_GANs**](Deep_Learning_Course/Exersice_#3_VAE_&_GANs/): In this exercise, you will explore two powerful generative models: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). You will learn how VAEs can be used for data generation and latent space interpolation, and how GANs can generate realistic synthetic data by competing against a discriminator network.

NOTE: Each exercise folder contains a set of tasks and exercises along with their respective solutions. Each exercise has ```ex_instructions.pdf``` and also the solutions implemented in a ```ex_code.ipynb``` notebook and analyzed in a ```ex_report.pdf``` file. 

We hope you find this course and the accompanying exercises valuable for your deep learning journey. Happy learning!
